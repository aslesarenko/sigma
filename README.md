# Sigma: Scala DSL for smart contracts with zero knowledge proof of knowledge  

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aslesarenko/sigma.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aslesarenko/sigma)

## Intro
 SigmaDsl is designed to be a frontend for Ergo Virtual Machine (ErgoVM). 

### Building the project and running tests

[SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) is required to build Sigma. See SBT documentation for installation and usage instructions.

Sigma depend on [Special](https://github.com/scalan/special)

If you want to create your own project depending on Special, you should use `publishLocal` SBT command to publish Special artifacts to your local Ivy repository and add dependencies as usual.

### Stability

Currently this is experimental research playground and quite far from stable release. 
If you are interested to try it out for you special case, please get in touch.

## Contributions

Minor pull requests (typos, bug fixes and so on) are gladly accepted; for anything larger please raise an issue first.

Issues with the `low-hanging fruit` label should be easy to fix if you want something to get started with.

If you want to start working on an issue (existing or one you just raised), please label it `in progress`.
